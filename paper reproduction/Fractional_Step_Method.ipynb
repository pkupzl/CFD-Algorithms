    "The **fractional step method** has a few major drawbacks. In general, the method is **first-order accurate in time**, and serious confusion and/or disagreement concerning boundary conditions and the details of the methods implementation exists. This paper shows that these problems can be resolved by resisting the urge to view the fractional step method as a time splitting and, instead, viewing it as an approximate block Lu factorization of the fully discretized equations."

Although the system is typically sparse, it is also large and indefinite. The submatrices $D$ and $G$ are not square, and only the submatrix $A$ is invertable. Ideally, we would like to simplify the problem and take advantage of some of the properties of the submatrices that might make inversion easier, For instance, usually $D = G^{T} $, and often $A$ is **symmetric and positive definite**. On Cartesian finite difference or finite volume grids, $A$ is block **diagonal** and can be further factored into a series of tridiagonals."
